[BuckleScript](https://bucklescript.github.io) bindings for
[React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) allows to use
[ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io) with
[ReasonReact](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/) to make your iOS,
Android and [Web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web) apps.

## üö® Usage from Git repo

If you use this bindings from the git repo, be sure to use

```js
{
  // ...
  "bs-dependencies": [
    // BsReactNative, current "stable" bindings
    "bs-react-native/bs-react-native",
    // ReactNative, WIP on zero-cost bindings (require bs-platform 5.0.0 & and reason-react hooks branch)
    "bs-react-native/bs-react-native-next"
  },
  // When used from git with the following path, bs-platform will use path that won't be working
  // (because deps are pointing to folder in folder)`
  // Your bundler (metro or webpack) will say that it can find `bs-react-native/whatever` and/or
  // `bs-react-native-next/whatever`
  // which is correct because it should be `bs-react-native/bs-react-native/whatever` / `bs-react-native/bs-react-native-next/whatever`
  // the trick below will correct path in generated JavaScript files
  // and will just need to be removed when you won't use git directly anymore
  "js-post-build": {
    "cmd": "./node_modules/bs-react-native/git-monorepo-usage-trick"
  }
}
```

Did you notice that this way, you can use both bindings to slowly migrate?

_Next ReactNative zero-cost bindings are still WIP, so use carefully at your own
risk._
