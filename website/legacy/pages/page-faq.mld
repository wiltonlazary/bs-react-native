{1 Troubleshooting}

Please find a list of common problems when working with [bs-react-native] below. If you have encountered an error that affected many developers, consider

{3 [Native module cannot be null] with create-react-native-app}

Currently BuckleScript can generate [import * as ReactNative from 'react-native'], which breaks [create-react-native-app]. To get around this you can
force BuckleScript to generate CommonJS modules instead of ES Modules using:

{[
/* bsconfig.json */
{
  /* ... */
  "package-specs": [
    {
      "module": "commonjs"
    }
  ]
}
]}
